# One More Thing

**omt** is a simple cli tool for retrieving random string values from a list of strings.
By default omt writes its output to a save file and each item can only be retrieved from the list of things once.

## Installation

To install omt you currently do need to install Rust and cargo on your system, checkout this repository and build it yourself.
However I intend to provide prebuild binaries as well as a homebrew tap in the future. I might also add a omt to nix-pckgs.
Parts of omt might also be published to crates.io as a library...
